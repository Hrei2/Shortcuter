## 10/4/2025 8 PM - Found the correct(and cheapest) parts  

![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6Mzg2LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--e4dff967ebfd3eb01918bc3d14e960683eaf33b0/image.png)

Searched the world wide web for all the required parts. Seems easy unless you want to save money on shipping, so you have to order everything from one spot... How I hate that store place item for 2 EUR next to one for 7 EUR and you do not even realise that the cheaper one has 10 EUR shipping.

Anyways that is my current part list :/. Have to double check everything but it seems to be correct as far as I can see. Might ask my robotics teacher for verification. And after that suprise my dad with a chance to sponsor my Xth project :D.

Time spent(simplified to 53 min for logging):

## 10/4/2025 10 PM - Made a wire diagram, trello page, upgraded parts list  

Created a trello page for this project. ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDI1LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--156a5eb7ffe51bad4f5621d9c8d3aa0075c83174/image.png)

Researched and made a schematic. (Sorry for the screen pins not being with their correct names. Could not understand how to do it corrctly) ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDI2LCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--83d2b2d6abf2946ea51e5c0485ca693ad59312ef/image.png)

Changed the screens to a Nextion one as my research showed it to be better(and more expensive :/). Changed the buzzers to a 2 pin version for now. Current running total is 64.55 EUR (at least I qualify for free shipping ;) ). There should be discounts from seventh to eight of October so should get it for cheaper. If not might sacrafice something.

Will start writing the code tomorrow(today as it is 1:06 AM right now).  

## 10/5/2025 - Too much stuff to fit in the header (╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻  

1. Found aproximatly the same things in aliexpress. The total is about 48 EUR instead of 64 EUR now.

2. Started learning about nextion screens. Installed the nextion editor and made the first possible button layout by calculating how big each button should be and guestimating the right size. Current version in the picture. ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjIwLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--b84dd0c97f485932537b5a093b5888497d1b9008/image.png)

3. Made the first iteration of arduino micro code. Also much guestimating because I found no way to emulate my planned set up. Currently have no physical buttons in my current code. Still thinking if they are required. And if it even will be required to have multiple screens. [O.o]

4. Made the first design for the case. Found some mesurements on the web. 100% some things are completely off so I left more space free. ![image.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/redirect/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NjIxLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--31cf77e3412748364c7beb13a1c18c3e79713d3d/image.png)

5. Thinking of shipping the project now to understand the grant I would get and then thinking of what I should keep, what to remove, and what to downgrade.


Will add all my file to my GitHub repository now.

## 10/4/2025 - Found the correct(and cheapest) parts

Searched the world wide web for all the required parts. Seems easy unless you want to save money on shipping, so you have to order everything from one spot... How I hate that store place item for 2 EUR next to one for 7 EUR and you do not even realise that the cheaper one has 10 EUR shipping.

Anyways that is my current part list :/. Have to double check everything but it seems to be correct as far as I can see. Might ask my robotics teacher for verification. And after that suprise my dad with a chance to sponsor my Xth project :D.

Time spent(simplified to 53 min for logging):
